			<p>Welcome to Kidstir! We are moms who want to raise children who have a healthy and happy connection to food. We believe good food can be fun for kids-from shopping at the farmer's market for ripe raspberries to cooking up a batch of homemade granola bars together in the kitchen. By educating and empowering our kids about food, we can prepare them to make smart, healthy choices, no matter what comes their way!</p>

			<p>That's why we launched Kidstir. We took our experiences as cookbook authors and chefs, and from Disney, Parents, Scholastic and Mattel, and developed an experience that kids and parents love. With our monthly hands-on kits, kids get to build their own cookbooks, try new foods, and learn all about where food comes from. They also gain important life skills in the kitchen-and cook up some fun family memories!</p>

			<p>As our company has grown it has been incredibly satisfying to hear how much joy and learning our kits have brought to all different kinds of families, including those who live in cities and suburbs across the US and Canada, military outposts (APOs), home schoolers, and those with children with special needs.</p>

			<p>Starting in 2015, we are excited to announce our partnership with the California Autism Foundation for fulfillment services. The mission of the California Autism Foundation is to provide people with autism and other developmental disabilities the best possible opportunities for lifetime support, training and assistance to help them reach their highest potential for independence, productivity, and fulfillment. The Foundation operates both a school for 6-22 year olds and a Custom Assembling and Packaging Services (CAP) division. It's evident that we are a wonderful match at many levels.</p>

			<p>Here's to doing the right thing, the right way, and with the support of the best community and customers we could ask for! Thank you, and onward bound!</p>

				<p>"Good food is a key aspect of physical and psychological health for children. As a pediatrician, I see many families who need and want to be healthier, but struggle to do so because of their hectic schedules. Kidstir's kits address this problem by offering families a simple, easy way to spend time together while learning healthy habits that can last a lifetime."</p>

				<p>"Children's growing bodies and minds are sensitive to artificial ingredients- an important reason for young families to eat real foods. And, getting children involved in cooking early increases the likelihood that they'll make positive nutritional choices on their own. Picky eaters, for example, are more likely to try foods they've helped to cook. These are just some of the reasons that I support Kidstir's mission and products."</p>

				<p>"When parents and children cook together, children develop sensory and motor skills, learn about the world around them- math, science, vocabulary, geography, and more- and develop healthy habits that prime them for academic and social success. I am impressed with the educational impact of Kidstir's kits, and believe the hands-on, parent/child activities present a welcome alternative to screen time."</p>
