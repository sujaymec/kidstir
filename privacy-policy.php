<p><b>1. </b><b>OUR OFFERING</b>. Our Services are for parents (and not for children) who want to spark a love of good food in their family. When you initially subscribe to our Services and become a "<b>Member</b>", we will send to you a Cookbook Kit, which includes a cookbook binder, recipes and/or tools. Then, each month as long as you maintain your subscription as a Member, you will receive a different "<b>Kit</b>" for your binder. Kits may include recipes, cooking tools and/or ingredients. We may also sell Kits and other products ("<b>Products</b>") on a stand-alone basis. SOME PRODUCTS MAY CONSITUTE CHOKING HAZARDS AND/OR CONTAIN SMALL PARTS OR OTHERWISE DANGEROUS COMPONENTS. PLEASE BE CAREFUL. KITS ARE NOT FOR CHILDREN UNDER THREE (3) YEARS OF AGE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED BY ANY CHILD WITHOUT ADULT SUPERVISION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED OR INTENDED FOR USE BY CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF THREE (3) AND MAY CONTAIN SMALL PARTS. IN ADDITION TO ALL OTHER LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS AGREEMENT, KIDSTIR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, FOR ANY CLAIMS, LIABILITY, DAMAGES, LOSS OR COSTS ARISING FROM SUCH USE</p>
<p><b>1.1 </b><b><span class="underline-text">Kits</span></b>. Membership fees are set forth on our Website, as may be amended from time to time.

Kidstir reserves the right to make deliveries in installments. Membership includes any applicable shipping, handling and taxes for the Kits, except in California and where otherwise required by law, where sales tax will be separately charged.. All Kits shall be deemed accepted by you upon shipment, and title to, and risk of loss of, each Kit passes to you when Kidstir provides the Kit(s) to a common carrier. All Kits are non-refundable and cannot be returned. However, please contact us if any or all of your Kit is damaged and we will work with you to provide a replacement Kit or component.</p>
<p><b>1.2 </b><b><span class="underline-text">Shipment</span></b>. Currently, we ship to the United States only. Any estimated shipping date provided by Kidstir is based on Product availability and payment processing time, and does not include transit time. All Products shall be deemed accepted by you upon shipment, and title to, and risk of loss of, the Products passes to you when Kidstir provides the Product(s) to a common carrier. Â Kidstir reserves the right to charge an additional fee if you request that any Products be re-shipped, whether because you originally submitted an incorrect address when you placed your order with Kidstir or otherwise. Accordingly, please be sure and review the shipping information you submit very closely to ensure it is accurate.</p>
<p><b>1.3 </b><b><span class="underline-text">Standalone Orders</span></b><span class="underline-text">.</span> When you place an order for Products (other than Membership) (such order, an "<b>Order</b>"), that will constitute an offer to purchase the Product(s) ordered and we may accept your Order by processing your payment and shipping the Product(s). Your receipt of an electronic or other form of Order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your Order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. For any reason, we may decline to accept your Order or any part of your Order. No Order will be considered accepted by Kidstir until the Product(s) has been shipped. If some of Products in your Order are temporarily out of stock, we will ship the available Products only and notify you of any Products that cannot be fulfilled. If we decline to accept your Order, we will attempt to notify you at the email address you provided. We further reserve the right any time after receipt of your Order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item. Your Order will be deemed accepted by Kidstir upon our delivery of the Products that you have ordered. We may require additional verifications or information before accepting any Order. All Products shall be deemed accepted by you upon shipment, and title to, and risk of loss of, the Products pass to you when Kidstir provides the Product(s) to a common carrier. All sales of Products are subject to our then-current return policies, as posted on the Website. Any estimated shipping date provided by Kidstir is based on Product availability and payment processing time, and does not include transit time.</p>
<p><b>1.4 </b><b><span class="underline-text">Products</span></b>. We make efforts to display our Products and their colors as accurately as possible. Having said that, the displayed colors of the Products will depend upon your monitor and we cannot guarantee that your monitor will accurately portray the actual colors of the Products. Products displayed may be out-of-stock or discontinued, and prices are subject to change. We cannot confirm the price of an item until you place an Order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items on our Website may be mispriced. We are not responsible for typographical errors regarding price or any other matter. All prices do include shipping and handling and sales taxes (except in California and where otherwise required by law, where tax will be added to your total purchase price). You are responsible for the payment of any shipping and handling charges and state and local sales or use taxes that may apply to your order.</p>
<p><b>1.5 </b><b><span class="underline-text">Membership</span></b>. Except as set forth below, members can cancel their Membership at any time, and will only be billed for the current month's Kit. Â There are no cancellation fees or penalties. Â To cancel your Membership, simply log into your Account and select the designated option to submit your cancellation. Â Your cancellation request must be received before 12 AM Eastern Standard Time <b><span class="underline-text">SEVEN ("7") DAYS PRIOR</span></b> to the next re-billing date, otherwise you will continue to be billed for the next planned kit.

Such gift subscriptions will also not automatically renew.</p>
<p><b>1.6 </b><b><span class="underline-text">Refer a Friend</span></b>. As a Member, by referring your friends to Kidstir, you may participate in the Kidstir Refer A Friend Program (the "<b>Program</b>"), which is a loyalty program we offer to our Members. If you choose to participate in the Program, for each friend you refer to Kidstir for which a Qualifying Referral (defined below) is completed, you may be able to receive credits toward future purchases. In order to receive a Referral Reward, each of the following requirements must be met (collectively, a &#8220;<b>Qualifying Referral</b>&#8220;): (i) you must log in to your Account on the Site and select the &#8220;Refer My Friends&#8221; link; (ii) you must share the link provided with friends via Facebook and Twitter, by copying and pasting the unique referral link generated via the Services, or by sending the unique referral link generated via the Services in an email via the Services to your friends; (iii) a friend who clicks the link on Facebook, Twitter or otherwise or clicks the link contained in the email must create a Kidstir Account and complete a purchase of a Membership through the Site or Services. Gift Certificate purchases or purchases of stand-alone Products are not Qualifying Referrals. Satisfaction of a Qualifying Referral and the applicable referral credits ("<b>Rewards</b>") you receive will be reflected in your Account in a commercially reasonable amount of time after the Qualifying Referral has been completed. The Rewards you accrue will be displayed in your My Account profile page. Rewards can be accrued solely by you and you may not earn Rewards by permitting another individual to use your Account. Rewards accrued in multiple Accounts may not be combined into one Account. You may not earn Rewards by creating multiple Accounts. You may not post your unique referral link on any public forum or coupon site, doing so will result in the reversal of any Rewards earned and may result in your account becoming suspended. By acquiring Rewards, you agree and acknowledge that Kidstir is granting you a limited, revocable license to a digital item, and that Rewards are not your personal property. You may not obtain any cash or money in exchange for Rewards. Except as explicitly provided herein, Rewards are non-transferable. Members are responsible for keeping track of the Rewards in their Accounts.</p>

<p><b>8.2 </b><b><span class="underline-text">Content Provided by Other Users</span>.</b> The Kidstir Properties may contain User Content provided by other Users.

You use all User Content and interact with other Users at your own risk.</p>
<p><b>9. </b><b>Third-Party Services. </b>The Kidstir Properties may contain links to third-party websites (<b>"Third-Party Websites"</b>) and advertisements for third parties (collectively, <b>"Third-Party Websites &amp; Ads"</b>). When you click on a link to a Third-Party Website or Ad, we will not warn you that you have left the Kidstir Properties and are subject to the terms and conditions (including privacy policies) of another website or destination. Such Third-Party Websites are not under the control of Kidstir. Kidstir is not responsible for any Third-Party Websites &amp; Ads. Kidstir provides these Third-Party Websites &amp; Ads only as a convenience and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third-Party Websites &amp; Ads, or their products or services.

You should review applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any Third-Party Websites, and should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party.</p>
<p><b>10. </b><b>Fees and Purchase Terms.</b></p>
<p><b>10.1 </b><b>Payment</b>. To make a payment, you will need to provide Kidstir with the information necessary to process your Order or your Membership, including your shipping address and the billing information requested on the Website. We may use a third-party payment provider (the "<b>Payment Provider</b>") to bill you through a payment account linked to your Account (your "<b>Billing Account</b>"). The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Provider in addition to this Agreement. We are not responsible for error by the Payment Provider. By becoming a Member or placing an Order, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Provider, all applicable charges applicable to your Account and you authorize us, through the Payment Provider, to charge your chosen payment provider (your "<b>Payment Method</b>"). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment. You authorize us to charge your Billing Account at our convenience but within thirty (30) days of credit card authorization. You represent that you will not use any Billing Account unless you have all necessary authorization to do so. We assume that because Billing Accounts require a valid credit card, only persons age 18 or over are placing Orders or becoming Members. We shall not be liable in the event your children or others acting with or without your permission use your credit card or other means of payment to make purchases on the Website (and to the extent your minor children make any such purchases, you hereby represent and warrant that they are authorized to do so); however you may report any unauthorized use to us, and we will use reasonable measures within our control to help prevent future unauthorized use of your card.</p>
<p><b>10.2 </b><b>Membership</b>. Membership at Kidstir consists of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that Membership has an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., WEEKLY OR MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, PLEASE ACCESS YOUR ACOUNT PAGE ON THE SERVICES. You must promptly notify us if your Payment Method is canceled (e.g., for loss or theft) or if you become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized use of your Account.</p>
<p><b>(a) </b><i>Change in Amount Authorized</i>. If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.</p>
<p><b>(b) </b><i>Auto-Renewal for Membership.</i> Unless you terminate your subscription, which can be done through your Account, your Membership will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate. To change or terminate any Membership at any time, go to _______________, provided that any termination will not be effective until the end of your then-current term. You won&#8217;t be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period.</p>
<p><b>(c) </b><i>Reaffirmation of Authorization</i>. Your non-termination or continued Membership reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for Membership. Upon renewal of your subscription, if Kidstir does not receive payment from your Payment Provider: (i) you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand, and/or (ii) you agree that Kidstir may either terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment Provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your Account will be re-activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new membership commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received). This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to become a Member.</p>
<p><b>(d) </b><i>Free Trials.</i> Any free trial or other promotion that provides Membership must be used within the specified time of the trial. You will be asked for valid credit card information when you sign up for the free trial. We will use the payment information for future Membership fees should you fail to terminate the trial Membership within the timeframe provided by Kidstir. We will start your free trial upon completion of your trial signup. You may cancel your trial Membership without charge at any time within [7] days of placing your order. <strong>If you do not cancel your free trial Membership within </strong>[7]<strong> days of the date you start your trial, your Membership will continue automatically and the monthly fee will be billed to the credit card or other billing source provided by you when you signed up for the trial, on the first day of each successive Membership term. Such billing will occur without further notice to you.</strong> Should you choose to discontinue your Membership for any reason before expiration of the then applicable Membership term or the trial period, you may cancel your Membership and terminate future billing by making the selection on your Account page. <strong>You must cancel your Membership before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged a Membership fee.</strong> If you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a Membership, please contact Kidstir to have the charges reversed.</p>
<p><b>10.3 </b><b><span class="underline-text">Other Promotions</span>.</b> We may run promotional offers from time to time on the Website. The terms of any such promotion will be posted on the Website. Unless otherwise indicated, we may establish and modify, in our sole discretion, the terms of such offer and end such offer at any point.</p>
<p><b>10.4 </b><b><span class="underline-text">Disputes</span>.</b> You must notify us in writing within seven (7) days after receiving your credit card statement, if you dispute any of our charges on that statement or such dispute will be deemed waived. Please use our Contact Us form for any billing disputes.</p>
<p><b>11. </b><b>Indemnification. </b>You agree to indemnify and hold Kidstir, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners and licensors (collectively, the <b>"Kidstir Parties"</b>) harmless from any losses, costs, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) relating to or arising out of: (a) Your Content; (b) your use of, or inability to use, the Kidstir Properties; (c) your violation of the Terms; (d) your violation of any rights of another party, including any Users; or (e) your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations.

<p><b>18.5 </b><b><span class="underline-text">Compliance</span>.</b> If you believe that Kidstir has not adhered to the Terms, please contact Kidstir by using our Contact Us form. We will do our best to address your concerns. If you feel that your complaint has not been addressed completely, we invite you to let us know for further investigation.</p>
<p><b>18.6 </b><b><span class="underline-text">Limitations Period</span>. </b>YOU AND KIDSTIR AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TERMS, THE KIDSTIR PROPERTIES OR THE CONTENT MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>
<p><b>18.7 </b><b><span class="underline-text">Dispute Resolution</span>.</b></p>
<p><b>(a) </b>Any claim or dispute (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms where the total amount of the award sought is less than Five Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $5,000.00) may be resolved in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. Such arbitration shall be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution provider (<b>"ADR Provider"</b>) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section and under the rules of such ADR Provider, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The party demanding arbitration will propose an ADR Provider and the other party shall not unreasonably withhold consent to use such ADR Provider. The ADR Provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (1) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (2) all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English; (3) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties; and (4) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Kidstir may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction. Please note that the laws of the jurisdiction where you are located may be different from California law, including the laws governing what can legally be sold, bought, exported, offered or imported. You shall always comply with all the international and domestic laws, ordinances, regulations and statutes that are applicable to your use of the Kidstir Properties.</p>
<p><b>(b) </b>Any other dispute (including whether the claims asserted are arbitrable) shall be referred to and finally determined by binding and confidential arbitration. Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (<b>"AAA"</b>). As modified by the Terms, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively <b>"Rules and Procedures"</b>).</p>
<p><b>(c) </b>You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a <span class="underline-text">FAIR HEARING,</span> BUT the arbitration procedures are <span class="underline-text">SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED</span> THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to <span class="underline-text">VERY LIMITED REVIEW</span> BY A COURT.</p>
<p><b>(d) </b>You and Kidstir must abide by the following rules: (i) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR KIDSTIR MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (ii) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (iii) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Kidstir will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation; (iv) Kidstir also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (v) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (vi) the arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for the purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (vii) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (viii) each side pays its own attorneys' fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and then in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by applicable law.</p>
<p><b>(e) </b>The arbitral proceedings, and all pleadings and written evidence will be in the English language. Any written evidence originally in a language other than English will be submitted in English translation accompanied by the original or true copy thereof. The English language version will control. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator will not have authority to award damages in excess of the amount, or other than the types, allowed by Section 13 of the Terms. Judgment on the award of the arbitrator may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator also shall be authorized to grant any temporary, preliminary or permanent equitable remedy or relief it deems just and equitable and within the scope of the Terms, including, without limitation, an injunction or order for specific performance. The arbitration award shall be final and binding upon the parties without appeal or review except as permitted by California law or United States federal law.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Kidstir may bring an individual action in small claims court. Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party's patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement. Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in Los Angeles, California. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in Los Angeles, California, in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Los Angeles, California for such purpose. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.</p>
<p><b>(f) </b>With the exception of (d)(i) and (ii) above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, either (d)(i) or (ii) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Kidstir shall be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason, a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court in Los Angeles, California. By using the Kidstir Properties in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration provision.</p>

<p><b>18.11 </b><b><span class="underline-text">Waiver</span>.</b> Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of the Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.</p>
<p><b>18.12 </b><b><span class="underline-text">Severability</span>.</b> If any provision of the Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of the Terms will remain enforceable, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
<p><b>18.13 </b><b><span class="underline-text">Export Control</span>.</b> You may not use, export, import, or transfer the Kidstir Properties except as authorized by U.S. law, the laws of the jurisdiction in which you obtained the Kidstir Properties, and any other applicable laws.

<p><b>18.14 </b><b><span class="underline-text">Entire Agreement</span>.</b> The Terms are the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and merges all prior discussions between the parties with respect to such subject matter.</p>
