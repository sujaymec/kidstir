		        When you sign up for the monthly membership, you will be billed for your first kit immediately. After that, you will be billed on the 25th of each month prior to the shipment of your kit, as this allows us to process and fulfill your order. As an example, you will be billed for your March kit on February 25.

		        You can cancel your monthly subscription at any time. Simply go to My Account, and select "Cancel" next to the subscription that you'd like to end. You must cancel before the 25th of the month to avoid being shipped and billed for the next month's kit.  Gifts and single kit purchases are not cancellable.

		        At check-out enter the address you would like your first box sent to. When you want to change the address please send us an email at hello@kidstir.com and we can update the new address for you. Kits are always addressed to the child's name. Kids love getting mail! Please note: We encourage customers to use only one address for shipment as it is easy to forget to update the shipping information later in the month. We are not able to ship multiple kits if the incorrect address has been provided.
